# Fizzy

### Introduction

[FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a famous programming challenge meant to test your approach to a simple problem. Today we'll be doing a very simple version of that simple problem. No loops (yet), but single-number FizzBuzz is an excellent test of our branching logic abilities! What's more, there are many different approaches to this problem--what path will you take?


### Tools Used

You'll get practice with the following:

* Full-featured functions (parameters and return values).
* `if-else` statements.
* Modulus operations.


### Setup

You'll only write one function this time, but there are various inputs you'll need to handle, so this is a test-driven exercise.

* Fork, clone, and navigate to this repo.
* Run `npm install` and `npm test`.
* Code away until the results are all green.
